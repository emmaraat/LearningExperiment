<h1 class="consent" id="consentHeader">The effect of Spatial Frequency on Perceiving Abnormalities in Mammograms</h1>

<p class="consent" id="experimentIntroStart">
The University of York would like to invite you to take part in the following research project.<br>
Before agreeing to take part, please read this information sheet carefully and let us know if anything is unclear or you would like further information.<br><br>
The study is designed to investigate the effect of spatial frequency on the perception of abnormalities in mammograms based on a short flash of the image.<br>
You have been invited to take part because you are a specialist health practitioner (radiographer or radiologist) with formal qualification and/or experience in mammography image interpretation.<br><br>

<em><b>IMPORTANT:</b> This experiment needs to be done on a <u>laptop or PC</u> with a <u>working internet connection</u>.<br> 
Try to use the device with the best screen resolution and size available to you.<br>
You can only do this experiment in the following browsers: <u>Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari.</u><br>
Switch to one of these browsers if you are currently in a different one.<br>
Make sure your browser is taking up the whole screen.<br>
Try to find a <u>quiet environment with minimal distractions</u> before starting this experiment<br><br></em>
Click next to continue.

<p class="consent" id="experimentIntro" style="display:none">
In this experiment, bilateral mammograms with either CC or MLO view will be presented to you for 500 milliseconds.<br> 
After viewing the image, you will be asked to rate how certain you are that the mammograms came<br> from a woman with breast cancer, or who will develop it in the near future, on a scale of 0 (no) to 100 (yes).<br> 
Some of the mammograms you will see have been artificially modified to change their spatial frequency.<br> 
Try to not let this influence your decision, focus only on your impression of the abnormality of the mammogram.<br> 
A typical session will last approximately 30 minutes.<br><br>
Click next to continue.

It can also be a grocery store membership card, your drivers license, or any other card of the same standard card size - 3.37inch or 85.6mm).<br><br>

Scroll down until you see the image on the screen and the slider.<br>
Now take your card and use it to scale the image on the screen until it matches the size<br>
Hold your card onto the <u>bottom left corner</u> of the image, and adjust the slider below until the image matches the card.<br>

<h1 class="instructions" id="welcomeHeader" style="display:none">Instructions</h1>
<p class="instructions" id="welcomeInstructions" style="display:none">In this experiment, we are asking you to do something you would never do in real practice:<br>
We want you to make a decision about a pair of mammograms in a single glance.<br><br>

On each trial, either a CC or MLO view of both breasts will be flashed on the screen.<br>
You are asked to rate how certain you are that these images come from a woman with breast cancer, or who will develop it in the near future.<br>
In 50% of these images, there is cancer or it will develop in the near future.<br>
Some of the images you will see have been artificially modified.<br>
Try to not let this influence your decision, focus only on your impression of the abnormality of the mammogram.<br> 
The flashes will be far too short to permit the usual scrutiny you would use,<br>
but we want to know how much information you can gleam from a single glance.<br>
Please give it your best shot!<br><br>

To rate your certainty you will use your mouse to adjust the value of a slider on a 0-100 scale.<br>
Make the rating based on your first impression:<br>
0 means you are completely certain the images come from a healthy woman who will not develop breast cancer in the near future.<br>
100 means you are completely certain the images come from a woman who has or will develop breast cancer in the near future.<br>
Please adopt a liberal criterion, while being as accurate as possible.<br>
To submit your rating, press the spacebar.<br>
The next trial will start automatically after you press the space bar, so make sure you are ready and looking at the center of the screen.<br><br>


The experiment will start with 3 practice trials. Then, you will do three experimental blocks of 120 trials each.<br>
A typical session will last approximately 30 minutes.<br><br>

Make sure you are in a quiet environment with minimal distractions and focus only on your screen.<br>
Make sure you are in <u>full screen mode</u>, use F11 (windows) or Control + Command + F (mac) if you are not in full screen yet.<br><br>

Press next when you have read and understood these instructions.<br>
Pay close attention, the first practice trial will start automatically!<br>
